  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, popularly known as UAVs, have been used in many applications, from healthcare services to military assignments with diverse capabilities such as data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks. UAV’s have been recently used to provide Security as a Service (SaaS). SaaS involves techni- cal solutions like anti-virus and anti-spam software, firewalls, using secure operating systems, etc. UAV’s are resource-constrained devices, and thus they are connected to the base station (BS) so that they may avail the computational facilities of the BS. The UAV’s connect themselves to the base station using cluster heads (intermediary devices). At times several UAVs cooperatively come together to serve a given region and such a group of UAVs is called a swarm of UAVs. In real-world scenarios, many stakeholders come together to form UAV swarm configuration proving services to users. Each stakeholder wants to maximize his gains. In this work, we propose a pricing Stackelberg game among UAVs, Cluster heads, and BS by formulating their behavioral utilities. Using particle swarm optimization on each entity’s utility functions, we create an optimal price strategy for each entity to maximize their profit.},

  abstract={The batteries of electric vehicles enable the func- tionality of V2G networks. The purpose of V2G is to handle the trading of energy for electric vehicles powered by batteries as well as the power grid. This is essential to make more efficient use of the energy of the grid. The electrical energy stored in the EV batteries can function as a power source for the grid and other energy-deficient EVs. The energy stored in the batteries of the EVs could be used to pump power into the grid when the load on the grid is too heavy. Despite its wide-ranging applications, the privacy and safety of intelligent grids continue to be a severe problem. Any protocol designed for V2G applications must be safe, lightweight, and safeguard the car owner’s privacy. As individuals usually do not guard EVs and charging stations, physical security is also a must. To address these issues, we are proposing a Real-time Automotive Mutual Authentication protocol for V2G devices based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). PUFs are used by the proposed protocol to obtain a two- step mutual authentication (MA) between an EV and the Grid Server. It is lightweight, safe, and preserves privacy.},

Today, nearly all prominent stockmarkets such as the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, etc. are searching for a feasible alternative for a decentralized and safe stock exchange model. Because of its intrinsic capacity to provide a decentralized, safe network, the use of blockchain has recently been suggested to tackle these problems. However, blockchain suffers from problems with scalability, velocity and increased transaction fees. In this paper, we introduce a method centered on Distributed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for stock exchange management using IOTA. To create the model more smart and safe in the future, we train a neural network model using the Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), which can forecast future stock price fluctuations. When a customer creates a transaction, he gets a forecast of stock price variability. Once the transaction is verified, the transaction is added to the distributed IOTA network ledger. The model offers a fair and stable and safe stock exchange industry. The LSTM model achieves 99.71% accuracy with a mean square error of 0.0004 on the test dataset.},

V2V is often envisioned as a gl-to-peer (P2P) model of electric mercantilism for electric vehicle (EV) merchandising. With security vulnerability increasing, confidence in secured third parties is declining. Blockchain is becoming increasingly common as it provides a system for privacy conser- vation and efficient agreement without the need for trusted third parties. However, all operations in such a scheme are restricted by memory, time, computing capital, energy etc. and it is quite obvious that the mechanism for blockchain agreement is not sufficient to address all of them.

  abstract={EVs have been slowly replacing conventional fuel based vehicles since the last decade. EVs are not only environment- friendly, but when used in conjunction with a smart grid, opens up new possibilities and a Vehicle-Smart Grid ecosystem, commonly called V2G can be achieved. This would not only encourage people to switch to environment-friendly EVs or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), but it could positively aid in load management on the power grid, and present new economic benefits to all the entities involved in such an ecosystem. Nonetheless, privacy and security concerns remain the serious concerns of smart grids. The devices used in V2G are tiny, inexpensive, and resource constrained, which renders them susceptible to multiple attacks. Any protocol designed for V2G systems must be secure, lightweight, and must protect the privacy of the vehicle owner. Since EVs and charging stations are usually unguarded, physical security is also a must. To tackle these issues, we propose Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based Secure User Key-Exchange Authentication (SUKA) protocol for V2G systems. The proposed protocol uses PUFs to achieve a two-step MA between an EV and the Grid Server. It is lightweight, secure, and privacy preserving. SUKA has identity protection, privacy protection, message integrity, and location security. Simulations show that SUKA performs better and provides more security features than state-of-the-art V2G protocols. Using a formal security model and analysis, we have shown that our protocol is secure.},

Although HetNets provide various benefits, yet many open issues need to be addressed to harness their impact.

However, accurate recognition of cancerous lesions is immensely challenging owing to factors such as low contrast variation, heterogeneity and visual similarity between benign and malignant nodules. Deep learning techniques have been very effective in performing natural image segmentation with robustness to previously unseen situations, reasonable scale invariance and the ability to detect even minute differences. However, they usually fail to learn domain-specific features due to the limited amount of available data and domain agnostic nature of these techniques. This work presents an ensemble framework Deep3DSCan for lung cancer segmentation and classification. The deep 3D segmentation network generates the 3D volume of interest from computed tomography scans of patients. The deep features and handcrafted descriptors are extracted using a fine-tuned residual network and morphological techniques, respectively. Finally, the fused features are used for cancer classification. The experiments were conducted on the publicly available LUNA16 dataset. For the segmentation, the authors achieved an accuracy of 0.927, significant improvement over the template matching technique, which had achieved an accuracy of 0.927. For the detection, previous state-of-the-art is 0.866, while ours is 0.883.},

So, evaluating a credit score is a laborious and tedious task involving a lot of paperwork. In this paper, we propose how blockchain can provide the solution to decentralized credit scoring evaluation and reducing the amount of dependence of paperwork.

However, the dependence on third party for coordinating the energy trading decisions leads to a bottleneck for any distributed environment. Therefore, blockchain technol- ogy can provide a privacy-preserving and effective consensus mechanism without the control of trusted third party. Although blockchain provides inherent secure framework for transactional process, but the this security is because of computational com- plexity enforced. In SG environment, the conventional blockchain process could not be employed due to limited computational resources with EVs, which makes it difficult to solve the tough computational puzzles to validate the transactions. On the other hand, any compromise on the computation difficulty makes it more vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, in this paper, SmartChain: a blockchain inspired smart and scalable ledger framework which does not require much computational complexity is designed for secure peer-to-peer energy trading in SG ecosystem. The proposed framework is evaluated using the parameters such as execution and validation time. The results obtained depict the superiority of SmartChain in contrast to the conventional blockchain process.},

So we propose a novel distributed authentication approach
based on Shamir’s secret sharing that is resistant to noisy

  abstract={In recent years, IoT technology has been one of the most rapidly expanding fields, connecting over 27 billion connected devices worldwide. Increasing security concerns, such as software flaws and cyberattacks, limit the use of IoT devices. Tor, also known as "The Onion Router," is one of the most popular, secure, and widely deployed anonymous routing systems in IoT networks. Tor is based on a worldwide network of relays operated by volunteers worldwide. Tor continues to be one of the most popular and secure tools against network surveillance, traffic analysis, and information censorship due to its robust use of encryption, authentication, and routing protocols. However, ToR is not anticipated to be entirely safe. The increasing computational capabilities of adversaries threaten Tor's ability to withstand adversarial attacks and maintain anonymity. This paper describes the foundation of the Tor network, how it operates, potential attacks against Tor, and the network's defense strategies. In addition, the authors present a framework for deep learning that uses bandwidth performance to identify the server's location in Tor, thereby compromising anonymity. This paper examines Tor's network's current and projected future in the Internet of Things.},

mersive digital realms, is poised to reshape the future by
seamlessly merging physical reality with virtual environments.
Its potential to revolutionize diverse aspects of human existence,
from entertainment to commerce, underscores its significance. At
the heart of this transformation lies Generative AI, a branch of
artificial intelligence focused on creating novel content. Genera-
tive AI serves as a catalyst, propelling the Metaverse’s evolution
by enhancing it with immersive experiences. The Metaverse
is comprised of three pivotal domains, namely, text, visual,
and audio. The Metaverse’s fabric intertwines with Generative
AI models, ushering in innovative interactions. Within Visual,
the triad of image, video, and 3D Object generation sets the
stage for engaging virtual landscapes. Key to this evolution is
five generative models: Transformers, Diffusion, Autoencoders,
Autoregressive, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
These models empower the Metaverse, enhancing it with dynamic
and diverse content. Notably, technologies like BARD, Point-
E, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, GPT, and AIVA, among others,
wield these models to enrich the Metaverse across domains. By
discussing the technical issues and real-world applications, this
study reveals the intricate tapestry of AI’s role in the Metaverse.
Anchoring these insights is a case study illuminating Stable Dif-
fusion’s role in metamorphosing the virtual realm. Collectively,
this exploration illuminates the symbiotic relationship between
Generative AI and the Metaverse, foreshadowing a future where
immersive, interactive, and personalized experiences blackefine

  abstract={In recent years, the rapid development of wireless communication-based technologies has been particularly prominent in the context of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications. However, despite significant progress, the realization of the full potential of UAV-based applications is hindered by inherent security vulnerabilities, including the susceptibility of communication between drones and base stations to intrusion. This research addresses critical research gaps by proposing a novel authentication method that leverages Shamir's secret sharing. Unlike existing authentication protocols, which often rely on Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that assume resistance to noise and theoretical ideals, our approach acknowledges the potential errors in PUF responses. This accommodation allows for the successful authentication of legitimate UAVs, even in the presence of external environmental factors introducing noise in PUFs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive simulations were conducted using NodeMCU and Raspberry Pi devices. We show that our approach outclasses other existing methods across multiple dimensions with communication cost of mere 450 ms on NodeMCU. Additionally, it incurs lower communication costs (1600 bits) and storage costs (352 bits), showcasing superior efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust security and scalability while consuming reasonable energy levels, making it a comprehensive solution for UAV-based },

  abstract={Contact tracing remains essential in mitigating the spread of pan-
demics (including COVID-19). Specifically, backward contact tracing helps find
superspreaders and hidden chains of transmission from asymptomatically
infected users. However, most literature proposing contact tracing frameworks
and apps deployed by various countries do not attempt backward contact
tracing. In this work, we present a novel approach for Bidirectional contact
tracing. The proposed approach works using Bluetooth low-energy sensors
that detect the presence of users in a vicinity and inform a central backend
server of user presence. By fixing BLE-S in buildings, the proposed framework
can trace the contacts resulting from contamination of a location (indirect
contacts). We present two algorithms using which the proposed framework
can trace forward and backward contacts. Using a simulation, we also track
the spread of infection among different ‘Generations’ of the infected and the
impact of backward tracing on preventing the spread across generations.
We observe the effect of critical epidemiological parameters such as the
reproduction number (R) and the overdispersion parameter (k) specifically on
backward contact tracing efficiency},

The mechanism is designed to scale efficiently with UAV swarms

logic, providing a robust theoretical foundation, 2) empirical
results that confirm the protocol’s superior performance over
contemporary solutions in both speed and security, and 3) a

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.},
